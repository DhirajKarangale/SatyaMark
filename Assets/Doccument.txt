# SatyaMark

## Project Overview

SatyaMark is a centralized, AI-powered verification service designed to help users and platforms distinguish truthful digital content from misinformation in real time. It provides a universal, visual **trust signal** that can be embedded across applications via an SDK or API.

SatyaMark is built as **trust infrastructure**, not just a fact-checking tool.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Misinformation spreads faster than verified facts across social platforms, messaging apps, and digital media. This leads to confusion, erosion of trust, and real-world harm.

Current fact-checking solutions suffer from major limitations:

* Slow response times
* Fragmented and platform-specific implementations
* Poor detection of AI-generated or manipulated content
* Lack of transparency, sources, and confidence scores

There is no unified, real-time verification layer for the internet.

---

## 2. Core Idea

SatyaMark acts as a **central verification layer** for digital content.

Platforms integrate SatyaMark to:

* Verify content in real time
* Display standardized trust icons (verification marks)
* Allow users to inspect reasoning, confidence, and sources
* Accept feedback and re-verification requests

---

## 3. Current Capabilities

### Supported (Active)

* **Text verification** – most mature and reliable
* **Image verification** – early-stage, lower accuracy

### Planned (Future)

* Video verification
* Audio verification
* Hybrid verification combining multiple signals

SatyaMark follows an incremental rollout strategy, improving accuracy and coverage over time.

## 4. Verification Workflow

### Step 1: Content Ingestion

* Text
* Images

### Step 2: Claim Extraction

* NLP models extract factual claims from text
* Vision models analyze image content and metadata

### Step 3: Cross Verification

* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Vector search using FAISS / Milvus
* Trusted sources and internal knowledge bases
* Detection of AI-generated or synthetic media

### Step 4: Verdict Assignment

Each verification produces:

* A verification mark
* Confidence score
* Human-readable explanation

### Step 5: Feedback Loop

* Users can submit feedback or request rechecks
* The system improves continuously

## 5. Verification Marks

SatyaMark assigns clear, visual trust indicators to content:

* Correct
* Incorrect
* Verifiable
* Unverifiable
* Insufficient
* Pending
* AI-Generated
* Non AI / Human-Generated

These marks are designed to be instantly understandable by users.

---

## 6. Accuracy & Maturity Notes

* Text verification is currently the most reliable component
* Image verification is experimental and may have lower confidence
* Hybrid verification techniques are planned to improve accuracy
* SatyaMark prioritizes transparency over false certainty

---

## 7. Privacy & Data Handling

SatyaMark is privacy-first by design.

* No use of content for advertising, profiling, or resale
* Original text is not stored
* A short AI-generated summary of text may be stored for transparency
* Images may be temporarily stored only to display verification results on the SatyaMark platform
* Data is processed ephemerally wherever possible

---

## 8. AI Models & Processing

SatyaMark uses a combination of self-hosted systems and third-party Large Language Models.

Models may include:

* LLaMA 3 (Meta)
* Mistral 7B
* DeepSeek R1 & V3
* Hermes 3
* Qwen 2.5

Third-party models are accessed via Hugging Face and process data only to generate verification results. Data handling by these providers follows their respective privacy policies.

---

## 9. Platform Architecture

* Central verification backend
* SDK / API for cross-platform integration
* Real-time processing pipeline
* Modular and extensible design

---

## 10. Target Users

* Social media platforms
* Messaging applications
* Content publishers
* Moderation teams
* Researchers
* General public

---

## 11. Go-To-Market Strategy

* Pilot SDK with niche publishers and fact-checking NGOs
* Partnerships with messaging apps and CMS platforms
* Developer-first documentation and sample integrations

---

## 12. Monetization

* Tiered API / SDK subscriptions
* Enterprise verification and moderation features
* Analytics dashboards for moderation teams

---

## 13. Design Principles

* Transparency over certainty
* Trust before speed
* Privacy-first by default
* Honest accuracy disclosure
* Incremental and scalable rollout

---

## 14. Important Constraints

* Video and audio verification are not yet supported
* Image verification accuracy is currently limited
* SatyaMark should not be treated as infallible
* Avoid overpromising capabilities

---

## 15. One-Line Positioning

**SatyaMark is a trust infrastructure layer that verifies digital content and surfaces clear, evidence-backed credibility signals in real time.**
