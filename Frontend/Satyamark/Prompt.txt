You are a senior frontend + system architect working on an open-source AI verification platform called **SatyaMark**.
SatyaMark is both a **product website** and a **React library showcase**.

Your task is to **completely redesign and restructure the entire frontend** so it looks:
- Professional
- Legitimate
- Clean
- Modern
- Open-source friendly
- Mobile-first & fully responsive

--------------------------------------------------
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (MUST FOLLOW)
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, go through the **entire project** file by file.
   - Understand how data flows
   - Understand existing components, stores, utilities, and APIs
   - Understand how Chat, ResultCard, and processing logic work
   - Do NOT assume anything — analyze before changing

2. You are allowed to:
   - Change project structure
   - Rename files/folders
   - Refactor components
   - Rewrite UI completely
   - Improve architecture
   - Remove bad patterns
   - Introduce reusable layout components

3. EVERY file you write or modify must be:
   - 100% syntactically correct
   - Free from runtime errors
   - Free from TypeScript errors
   - Free from React warnings
   - Production-ready

4. Do NOT leave TODOs, placeholders, or broken imports.

--------------------------------------------------
GLOBAL UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------
- Use a **clean, modern SaaS-style UI**
- Consistent spacing, typography, and colors
- Dark theme preferred (professional AI product look)
- Smooth transitions (subtle)
- No visual clutter
- Mobile responsiveness is mandatory

--------------------------------------------------
NAVBAR (GLOBAL)
--------------------------------------------------
Create a modern sticky Navbar with:
- Logo / Brand: SatyaMark
- Navigation items:
  - Home
  - Chat
  - Documentation
- Desktop & mobile hamburger menu
- Active route highlighting
- Clean professional styling

--------------------------------------------------
PAGE: HOME
--------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Explain what SatyaMark is and why it exists.

Content to include:
- Clear hero section explaining SatyaMark
- What problems SatyaMark solves
- Supported verification types:
  - Text verification
  - AI image detection
  - Image forensics
- How it works (high-level flow)
- Open source focus

Add prominent CTA buttons:
- GitHub repository
- Live Demo
- NPM package

Reference logic/content from existing `Home.tsx`
but redesign the layout completely.

--------------------------------------------------
PAGE: CHAT
--------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Showcase SatyaMark in action.

Must include:
- Clean chat layout
- Input area for text or image URL
- ResultCard with:
  - Status mark
  - Confidence
  - Explanation
  - URLs if present
- Proper spacing so chat input never overlaps
- Scrollable result area
- Mobile-friendly layout

Reference logic from `Chat.tsx` and `ResultCard.tsx`
but redesign UI fully.

--------------------------------------------------
PAGE: DOCUMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Developer-first documentation.

Structure it properly:
1. Introduction to SatyaMark
2. Installation (NPM)
3. Basic usage example
4. Text verification example
5. Image verification example
6. Explanation of result states (marks)
7. Links to:
   - GitHub repo
   - Demo app
   - README

Use content from:
- `Doccumentation.tsx`
- README files

But rewrite it in a **clean, readable, well-structured layout**
with code blocks styled nicely.

--------------------------------------------------
ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------
- Introduce a shared `Layout` component
- Separate UI components vs logic
- Keep components small and reusable
- Avoid deeply nested JSX
- Use proper folder structure

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATION
--------------------------------------------------
- A fully redesigned SatyaMark frontend
- Professional open-source quality
- Code that can be directly merged
- No syntax, lint, or runtime errors
- Consistent styling across all pages

Proceed step-by-step:
1. Analyze existing project
2. Propose new structure
3. Implement redesign
4. Ensure everything works correctly
