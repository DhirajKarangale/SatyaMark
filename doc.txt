Description of Your Solution – SatyaMark

Problem You’re Solving:
Misinformation spreads faster than facts across social platforms, causing confusion, mistrust, and real-world harm. Existing fact-checking systems are slow, fragmented, and platform-dependent, leaving users struggling to know what to trust.

Why It’s Important / Unsolved:

There is no unified, real-time verification service across platforms.
Detection of AI-generated or manipulated media is limited.
Users lack transparent, evidence-backed verdicts to distinguish truth from misinformation.
What We Plan to Build:
SatyaMark is a centralized, AI-powered verification service designed to provide a universal “mark of truth” for all digital content. Apps integrate a lightweight SDK/library to display trust icons next to posts. Users can click the icon to view a detailed verification page and submit feedback or request rechecks.

How the AI Agent Will Function:

Ingest Multi-Modal Content: texts[], links[], images[], videos[]
Claim Extraction: NLP models extract factual claims from text; vision/video models analyze media.
Cross-Verification:
Checks claims against trusted sources, fact-check APIs, and internal knowledge base.
Uses RAG and vector search (FAISS / Milvus) for semantic retrieval.
Detects AI-generated content (deepfakes, synthetic media).
Verdict Assignment: Produces Correct, Incorrect, First-Time, AI-Generated, Pending, or Unverifiable status with confidence scores.
Feedback Loop: Users can submit evidence or request rechecks; the AI agent updates dynamically.
Key Features / Flow:

Cross-Platform SDK/Library: Easy integration, consistent verification icons.
Central Verification Server: Real-time AI analysis, multi-modal support.
Detail Page / Feedback Loop: Transparent explanations with sources and confidence.
Privacy & Data Handling: Anonymized data, ephemeral content storage.
Scalability & Reliability: Handles high-frequency requests; modular for future expansion.
